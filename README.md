# Practice using github

Goals: Generally I am hoping to have solid foundation for working with data in
R. I am also excited about learning how to properly save data on Github, and use
that software to have good version control. I would love to be able to write
useful code in R without the help of stack overflow or AI.

Reproducibility: This concept is important to me, because it allows me to work
effectively with my past and future self, in terms of limiting the amount of
time I have to spend deciphering my own work. It also allows others to follow
my process when I eventually get to the point of publishing my work.

Test: Test for the testing branch
